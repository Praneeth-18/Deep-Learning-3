# a)

This section encompasses a series of tasks aimed at demonstrating the application of machine learning models across different types of data and problems. We've tackled vision object detection, vision segmentation, tabular analysis, and recommendation system tasks using various datasets.

## 1. Vision Object Detection Task

**Dataset Used**: Flowers Dataset
- **Objective**: Our goal was to demonstrate how to set up an object detection task, which identifies and locates objects within images. For this task, we discussed the approach and model setup, considering a dataset containing images of flowers as an example.

## 2. Vision Segmentation Task

**Dataset Used**: CamVid Dataset
- **Objective**: The task focused on segmenting urban scenes, categorizing each pixel into predefined classes (such as road, car, pedestrian). We utilized the CamVid dataset, demonstrating how to prepare the data, train a U-Net model for segmentation, and evaluate the model's performance.

## 3. Tabular Task

**Dataset Used**: California Housing Dataset
- **Objective**: We explored a regression task aiming to predict house prices based on various features like location, house size, and number of rooms. Using the California Housing dataset, we covered data loading, model training with `fastai`'s tabular learner, and performance evaluation.

## 4. Recommendation Task

**Dataset Used**: Book-Crossing Dataset
- **Objective**: The final task involved building a recommendation system to suggest books based on user ratings. We navigated through data preparation challenges, model training with collaborative filtering techniques, and discussed potential approaches for making book recommendations to users.
