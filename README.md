# a)

This section encompasses a series of tasks aimed at demonstrating the application of machine learning models across different types of data and problems. We've tackled vision object detection, vision segmentation, tabular analysis, and recommendation system tasks using various datasets.

## 1. Vision Object Detection Task

**Dataset Used**: Flowers Dataset
- **Objective**: Our goal was to demonstrate how to set up an object detection task, which identifies and locates objects within images. For this task, we discussed the approach and model setup, considering a dataset containing images of flowers as an example.

## 2. Vision Segmentation Task

**Dataset Used**: CamVid Dataset
- **Objective**: The task focused on segmenting urban scenes, categorizing each pixel into predefined classes (such as road, car, pedestrian). We utilized the CamVid dataset, demonstrating how to prepare the data, train a U-Net model for segmentation, and evaluate the model's performance.

## 3. Tabular Task

**Dataset Used**: California Housing Dataset
- **Objective**: We explored a regression task aiming to predict house prices based on various features like location, house size, and number of rooms. Using the California Housing dataset, we covered data loading, model training with `fastai`'s tabular learner, and performance evaluation.

## 4. Recommendation Task

**Dataset Used**: Book-Crossing Dataset
- **Objective**: The final task involved building a recommendation system to suggest books based on user ratings. We navigated through data preparation challenges, model training with collaborative filtering techniques, and discussed potential approaches for making book recommendations to users.

# NLP with Transformers

This project demonstrates the use of modern NLP techniques with Transformers for various tasks. It showcases the versatility and power of pre-trained models in handling a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Below is an overview of the tasks covered, along with a brief description of each.

## Overview of NLP Tasks

### Text Classification
- **Objective**: Classify the sentiment of text data as positive or negative.
- **Application**: Sentiment analysis on customer feedback or reviews.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Objective**: Identify and classify named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) within text.
- **Application**: Extracting information from news articles or social media posts.

### Question Answering
- **Objective**: Extract an answer from a text given a question related to the text.
- **Application**: Building AI assistants or chatbots for automated customer support.

### Text Summarization
- **Objective**: Generate a concise and meaningful summary from a larger text.
- **Application**: Summarizing news articles, reports, or long documents.

### Translation
- **Objective**: Translate text from one language to another.
- **Application**: Making content accessible to a global audience by breaking language barriers.

### Zero-shot Classification
- **Objective**: Classify text into categories that were not seen during training.
- **Application**: Categorizing content into dynamically changing categories without re-training.

## Implementation Highlights
The project utilizes the `transformers` library from Hugging Face to implement these tasks. For each task, we leverage a specific pre-trained model suitable for the job at hand, illustrating the ease with which complex NLP tasks can be approached with state-of-the-art models.

- **Text Classification**: Used for analyzing sentiments of movie reviews.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Demonstrated on extracting entities like organizations and individuals from text.
- **Question Answering**: Showcased by finding answers from provided context.
- **Text Summarization**: Applied on summarizing news articles or scientific papers.
- **Translation**: Focused on translating English text to other languages such as French.
- **Zero-shot Classification**: Illustrated by classifying text into categories without explicit examples.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Transformers**: Main library used for accessing pre-trained models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Utilized for some of the NLP tasks and model fine-tuning.
- **Scikit-learn**: Employed for data preprocessing and splitting.
