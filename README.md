## 3. Tabular Task

**Dataset Used**: California Housing Dataset
- **Objective**: We explored a regression task aiming to predict house prices based on various features like location, house size, and number of rooms. Using the California Housing dataset, we covered data loading, model training with `fastai`'s tabular learner, and performance evaluation.

## 4. Recommendation Task

**Dataset Used**: Book-Crossing Dataset
- **Objective**: The final task involved building a recommendation system to suggest books based on user ratings. We navigated through data preparation challenges, model training with collaborative filtering techniques, and discussed potential approaches for making book recommendations to users.

# NLP with Transformers

This project demonstrates the use of modern NLP techniques with Transformers for various tasks. It showcases the versatility and power of pre-trained models in handling a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Below is an overview of the tasks covered, along with a brief description of each.

## Overview of NLP Tasks

### Text Classification
- **Objective**: Classify the sentiment of text data as positive or negative.
- **Application**: Sentiment analysis on customer feedback or reviews.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Objective**: Identify and classify named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) within text.
- **Application**: Extracting information from news articles or social media posts.

### Question Answering
- **Objective**: Extract an answer from a text given a question related to the text.
- **Application**: Building AI assistants or chatbots for automated customer support.

### Text Summarization
- **Objective**: Generate a concise and meaningful summary from a larger text.
- **Application**: Summarizing news articles, reports, or long documents.

### Translation
- **Objective**: Translate text from one language to another.
- **Application**: Making content accessible to a global audience by breaking language barriers.

### Zero-shot Classification
- **Objective**: Classify text into categories that were not seen during training.
- **Application**: Categorizing content into dynamically changing categories without re-training.

## Implementation Highlights
The project utilizes the `transformers` library from Hugging Face to implement these tasks. For each task, we leverage a specific pre-trained model suitable for the job at hand, illustrating the ease with which complex NLP tasks can be approached with state-of-the-art models.

# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a BERT model for sentiment analysis tasks using TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, and TensorFlow Text. It outlines the steps to prepare, process, and train the model using a dataset for binary sentiment classification.

## Overview

The project involves leveraging a pre-trained BERT model from TensorFlow Hub, processing input data using TensorFlow Text, and fine-tuning the model on a sentiment analysis task. The process is divided into several key steps, including setting up the environment, loading the pre-trained BERT model and preprocessor, preparing the dataset, and training the model.

## Environment Setup

- TensorFlow: Deep learning library for building and training neural network models.
- TensorFlow Hub: A library for reusable machine learning modules.
- TensorFlow Text: Provides text-related classes and ops ready to use with TensorFlow 2.0.

Ensure that all packages are installed and compatible with each other to avoid conflicts.

## Model Architecture

The architecture involves three main components:

1. **BERT Preprocessor**: A preprocessing layer from TensorFlow Hub that tokenizes and encodes the input text into formats suitable for BERT.
2. **BERT Encoder**: The pre-trained BERT model layer, also from TensorFlow Hub, that processes the encoded inputs.
3. **Custom Layers**: Additional layers added on top of the BERT Encoder for the specific task of sentiment analysis.

## Dataset Preparation

The dataset used for training should be split into training and validation sets, with each example labeled according to sentiment (positive or negative).

## Training Process

The training involves fine-tuning the BERT model on the sentiment analysis task. This can be done by adjusting various parameters and configurations to optimize performance.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy in classifying sentiments.

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model with TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub is a powerful approach for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. This project provides a foundational framework for such applications.
